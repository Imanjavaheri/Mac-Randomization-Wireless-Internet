# Mac-Randomization-Wireless-Internet
In this project, we study how the iPhone 12 and Samsung A31smartphones use MAC address 
randomization in their Wi-Fi probe requests. To do this, we used a sniffer in monitor mode along 
with Wireshark to capture and examine the probe request packets. We performed the experiment 
in different scenarios to better understand how the devices behave when sending probe requests.
